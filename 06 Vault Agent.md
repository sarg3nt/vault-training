# [Vault Agent](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/agent)

Vault Agent is a client daemon that provides the following features:

- Auto-Auth - Automatically authenticate to Vault and manage the token renewal process for locally-retrieved dynamic secrets.
- API Proxy - Allows Vault Agent to act as a proxy for Vault's API, optionally using (or forcing the use of) the Auto-Auth token.
- Caching - Allows client-side caching of responses containing newly created tokens and responses containing leased secrets generated off of these newly created tokens. The agent also manages the renewals of the cached tokens and leases.
- Windows Service - Allows running the Vault Agent as a Windows service.
- Templating - Allows rendering of user-supplied templates by Vault Agent, using the token generated by the Auto-Auth step.
